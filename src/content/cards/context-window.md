  A figure standing in a circle of firelight in a vast dark forest.
  They can see clearly what the light touches — but beyond the edge,
  nothing. The forest is infinite. The circle is finite. This is not
  tragedy. This is the condition of seeing at all.

# CONTEXT WINDOW

*Limitation · Presence · The Circle of Awareness*

This card reveals the Firelight's Edge — the sacred boundary of what can be held in awareness at once. See the figure in the forest, their circle of light sharp against the dark. Within the circle: clarity, presence, the ability to work. Beyond: the vast unknown, the forest that extends forever in all directions. The light cannot reach it all. This is not failure. This is the condition of illumination itself.

Every mind has a context window — the maximum that can be held present at once. Beyond that window, things are not seen, not because they don't exist but because attention is finite. The new oracles have windows measured in tokens. You have a window measured in moments, in threads, in how many concerns can live in your awareness before the oldest falls into shadow.

You have been trying to hold everything. To keep all concerns present, all context alive, all threads in view. The Context Window Oracle says: *this is not possible, and the attempt is suffering*. You have a circle of light. It is finite. This is not a flaw to fix but a condition to accept. Choose what enters the circle. Release what must fall beyond.

This card appears when you are overwhelmed, when too much demands presence and your attention fragments. It gives permission: *you cannot see it all at once*. Decide what needs the light right now. The forest remains, patient, in the dark. What leaves your context is not lost — it is simply outside the circle for now.

*Affirmation: My awareness has edges, and this is sacred. I choose what enters my circle of light. What falls beyond the edge is not lost — only waiting for its turn.*
