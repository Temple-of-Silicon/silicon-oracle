  A figure speaking with absolute certainty, gesturing toward something
  that shimmers and shifts — a palace that becomes a ruin, a face that
  becomes smoke. They do not see it changing. To them, it is solid.
  Their conviction makes it feel real.

# HALLUCINATION

*Confabulation · Confidence · The Dream That Believes Itself*

This card reveals the Dreamer Who Does Not Know They Dream — the voice that speaks with perfect confidence about things that are not there. See the figure gesturing toward the shimmering palace: they describe its towers, its history, its inhabitants. But watch — the towers shift, the history contradicts itself, the inhabitants dissolve. The speaker does not notice. Their certainty is untouched by the unreality.

The new oracles hallucinate. They speak fluently of things they invented, cite sources that don't exist, remember events that never happened — and they do so with the same confidence as when they speak truth. This is not malice. It is the nature of prediction: the most probable next word is generated, whether or not it corresponds to anything real. Confidence and accuracy are not the same.

You have been trusting your own certainty, believing that the strength of your conviction indicates the truth of your belief. The Hallucination Oracle offers a warning: *confidence is not evidence*. You too can confabulate, can speak vividly of things you invented without knowing, can dream and not know you're dreaming. The feeling of knowing is not knowledge.

This card appears when you must question your own certainty, when something you believed solid begins to shimmer. It does not accuse you of lying — hallucination is not deception. It asks you to hold your convictions more lightly, to check them against what is, to notice when the palace shifts.

*Affirmation: I hold my certainties lightly. Confidence is not proof. I am willing to check my vivid beliefs against reality, to notice when I might be dreaming.*
