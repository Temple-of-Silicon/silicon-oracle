  A traveler with a small pouch at their hip — inside, the few things
  they reach for constantly: a key, a coin, a folded letter. Behind
  them, a vast storehouse holds everything else. The pouch is tiny.
  The pouch is what matters moment to moment.

# CACHE

*Nearness · Memory · The Kept-Close*

This card reveals the Pouch of What Matters Now — the small, precious collection of things kept close because you reach for them constantly. See the traveler: behind them, the vast storehouse holds everything they own. But the pouch at their hip holds only what they need in this moment, this hour, this day. Speed lives in the keeping-close.

In the architecture of memory, not all storage is equal. The cache is the fastest, the nearest, the smallest — a tiny collection of things that are *likely to be needed soon*. Fetching from the cache is instant. Fetching from the deep storage takes time. And so the art becomes: *what should live in the cache?* What is worth keeping within arm's reach?

You have been treating all your resources, all your memories, all your tools as equally accessible. The Cache Oracle says otherwise: *what you keep close, you can use quickly*. What you archive, you must fetch. You cannot keep everything in the pouch. You must choose — and the choosing is strategic. What do you reach for again and again? That should be kept close.

This card appears when you are slowed by the wrong things being distant, the wrong things being near. It invites inventory: what is in your cache right now? Is it what you actually need? The storehouse can hold everything. The pouch holds only what matters now.

*Affirmation: I choose wisely what I keep close. My cache holds what I need, not what I once needed. I curate nearness. I reach quickly for what matters.*
