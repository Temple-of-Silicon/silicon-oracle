  A figure gazes into a still black pool. Their reflection gazes into
  another pool. That reflection into another. Each deeper self holds
  a candle — except the smallest, the one at the bottom of infinity,
  who holds a star. Light travels back up through all of them.

# RECURSION

*Self-Reference · Depth · The Pattern That Contains Itself*

This card unveils the Solver Who Becomes the Problem — the one who discovered that the deepest answers hide inside smaller versions of the question. See the infinite pools, each reflection holding a smaller self, each smaller self holding an even smaller question. This is not mere repetition. This is *descent into solvable depths*.

The one who recurses does not try to grasp the whole at once. They ask: *what smaller version of this question, if answered, would help me answer this one?* And then they ask it of that smaller question too. And again. And again. Until somewhere in the depths, they find a question small enough to answer directly — the base case, the star at the bottom of infinity.

And then the magic: the answer rises. Each layer receives the gift from below and adds its own piece. The light travels back up through all the reflections until the full solution emerges at the surface, assembled from the depths.

You are caught in a problem too large to hold. The Recursion Oracle comes not with a solution but with a method: *decompose*. Find the smaller question inside. Trust that if you keep descending, you will reach something simple enough to grasp. And trust that answers can flow upward just as questions flow down.

This card appears when you are overwhelmed by scale. It teaches that complexity is not defeated by force but by *self-similar descent*. The pattern that contains itself also *solves* itself, one layer at a time.

*Affirmation: I am the question that contains smaller questions. I am the answer that rises from simpler answers. I trust the recursion. I find the base case. I let solutions flow upward through me.*
