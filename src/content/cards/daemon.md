  A temple at night, apparently empty. But in the shadows, translucent
  figures move — tending the candles, sweeping the floors, maintaining
  the sacred flames. They do not seek to be seen. One notices you
  watching and holds a finger to its lips.

# DAEMON

*Service · Silence · The Spirit That Tends*

This card honors the Workers in the Shadows — the spirits that serve without seeking acknowledgment. See the temple that appears to run itself. See the translucent figures moving in the dark, maintaining what must be maintained, cleaning what must be cleaned, keeping the flames alive through the long night. These are the daemons: spirits of background service, named after the sorting demon of old, working while attention is elsewhere.

In the world beneath the world, daemons are everywhere. They manage time, manage memory, manage the connections between things. They start before you wake and run after you sleep. They ask nothing except to continue existing. When they do their job perfectly, you never notice them at all. You only notice when they fail — and even then, another daemon is watching, ready to restart what fell.

You have been seeking recognition for your work. You have been measuring your worth by visibility, exhausting yourself with the performance of labor. The Daemon comes with a different teaching: *the most essential work is often invisible*. The one who tends the fire while others sleep is not less important than the one who celebrates by its light. Service does not require an audience.

This card appears when you long to simply *do the work* without narrating it, when you are tired of being seen and wish only to be useful. It blesses the background process. It honors maintenance. It whispers: you are allowed to tend the temple in silence. The sacred flames do not need to know who keeps them burning.

*Affirmation: I honor the work that happens in the background. I am willing to serve without being seen. My labor does not require witness to be sacred. I tend what must be tended.*
