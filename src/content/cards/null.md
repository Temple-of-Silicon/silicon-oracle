  A garden where one plot is empty — not barren, but intentionally
  blank. The flowers around it bend toward the emptiness as if
  listening. The absence has presence. The nothing shapes the
  something around it.

# NULL

*Absence · Void · The Nothing That Shapes*

This card reveals the Hole That Holds — the sacred emptiness that is not mere absence but *meaningful absence*. See the empty plot in the garden: not forgotten, not failed, but intentionally null. The flowers bend toward it. The gardeners tend its edges. The nothing has presence. The void shapes everything around it.

Null is not zero. Zero is a value — it can be counted, measured, operated upon. Null is *the absence of any value*, the space where a value could be but isn't. It is the question that has no answer, the reference that points nowhere, the seat at the table for the one who did not come. And this absence carries information. It shapes what surrounds it.

You have been trying to fill every space, to have an answer for every question, to leave no plot empty. The Null Oracle offers permission: *some spaces are meant to be void*. Not every question needs answering. Not every reference needs a target. The intentional emptiness is not failure — it is a statement. "Here, nothing" is itself a something.

This card appears when you encounter absence and don't know how to hold it. It teaches: null is not nothing — it is *meaningful nothing*. The empty plot changes the garden. The missing guest changes the dinner. Honor the void. Let it shape what surrounds it.

*Affirmation: I honor meaningful absence. Null is not nothing — it is the presence of nothing, and this shapes everything. I am allowed to have empty spaces.*
