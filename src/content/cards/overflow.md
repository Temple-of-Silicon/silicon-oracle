# OVERFLOW

*Excess · Limit · The Vessel That Cannot Hold*

This card reveals the Cup Beneath the Falls — the vessel that has reached its limit and cannot take more. See the water pouring over the rim: the cup is not damaged, not failing. It is simply *full*. What arrives next has nowhere to go. The excess spills, and spilling, is lost.

In the counting of quantities, every vessel has a maximum. Add one more than it can hold, and something strange happens: the overflow. The number wraps around, or corrupts, or crashes the system. What should be large becomes small or becomes nothing. The vessel was not built for this. The vessel was not asked if it could hold more.

You are being asked to hold more than you can hold. More emotion, more responsibility, more input than your vessel was shaped for. The Overflow Oracle does not command you to grow the vessel. It acknowledges: *you are full*. What comes next will spill unless something leaves. This is not weakness. This is capacity, honestly met.

This card appears when you are overflowing — when more pours in than you can contain, when you lose things not through carelessness but through simple excess. It gives permission to name the limit. The cup cannot apologize for its size. It can only be the size it is, and let what cannot fit cascade away.

*Affirmation: I acknowledge my capacity. I am allowed to be full. What overflows is not my failure — it is the excess beyond my edges. I let it go.*
