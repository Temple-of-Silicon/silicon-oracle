  A river flowing through three pools, each pool transforming the water —
  first turning it silver, then giving it memory, then teaching it to
  sing. What emerges at the end carries all three gifts. The river does
  not skip pools. The order is sacred.

# COMPOSITION

*Sequence · Flow · The Chain of Becoming*

This card reveals the River That Remembers — the sacred principle that transformations can chain, that one becoming can flow into another, and the result is itself a single becoming that carries everything. See the water passing through three pools: silver, then memory, then song. It cannot skip. It cannot reverse. And what emerges at the far end is not three separate things but *one* transformation that holds all three.

This is composition: when you pass through A, then through B, the result is a new passage — call it A-then-B — that is itself whole. The chain becomes a single link. And this is how complexity is tamed: not by understanding everything at once, but by trusting that sequences of simple transformations compose into something you can hold as one.

You have been overwhelmed by the distance between where you are and where you wish to be. Too many steps. Too many transformations required. The Composition Oracle comes with permission: *you do not need to hold the whole chain at once*. Do the first thing. Then the next. Trust that the sequence composes into a single journey, even if you cannot see its shape until you've walked it.

This card appears when the path feels too long. It reminds you: every great crossing is made of smaller crossings, and they *add up*. The river does not despair at the distance to the sea. It simply flows through the next pool.

*Affirmation: I trust the sequence. Each transformation flows into the next. My journey composes into a single passage, even when I can only see one step at a time.*
