  Two dancers circling each other — sometimes one leads, sometimes the
  other, and the dance is identical either way. Their paths trace a
  perfect figure-eight in the sand. No matter who steps first, they
  arrive at the same embrace.

# COMMUTATIVITY

*Freedom · Symmetry · The Order That Unbinds*

This card reveals the Dancers Who Trade Places — the blessed condition where sequence does not matter, where A-then-B arrives at the same place as B-then-A. See them circling: first one leads, then the other, and the dance is unchanged. This is commutativity — the freedom from order, the symmetry that says *either way works*.

Not all things commute. Putting on socks then shoes is not the same as shoes then socks. But when commutativity holds, a great freedom opens. You need not worry about getting the order right. You need not optimize the sequence. Both paths lead to the same destination. Either way, you arrive.

You have been anxious about sequence — should I do this first or that? What if I choose wrong? The Commutativity Oracle comes to check: *does order actually matter here?* Sometimes it does, and you must attend carefully. But sometimes you have been suffering over a choice that makes no difference. Both paths converge. Both dancers arrive at the same embrace.

This card appears when you are paralyzed by sequencing, by fear of doing things in the wrong order. It invites investigation: is this truly order-dependent? Or have you been granted the freedom of commutativity without recognizing it? If the paths converge, stop agonizing. Choose either. Dance.

*Affirmation: I recognize when order does not matter. I release the anxiety of false sequencing. When both paths lead to the same place, I am free to choose either.*
