  A figure standing before two paths: one leads to a single, clear
  destination; the other branches into a hundred possibilities. The
  hundred-path glows brighter — more uncertain, more alive, more full
  of information. Entropy is the light of the unknown.

# ENTROPY

*Disorder · Surprise · The Measure of Not-Knowing*

This card reveals the Light of Uncertainty — the truth that disorder is not absence but *presence*, that not-knowing carries more information than knowing, that the hundred paths contain more than the one. See the figure before the branching: the single destination is dim with certainty, the manifold possibilities blaze with the light of what-might-be.

Entropy measures surprise. A message that tells you what you already knew carries no information. A message that could be anything — that surprises you completely — carries maximum information. This is the paradox: *disorder is rich*. Certainty is poor. The highest entropy state is not chaos but *pure potential*, every outcome equally possible.

You have been seeking certainty, trying to reduce options, to narrow the future to a single clear path. The Entropy Oracle asks: *what are you losing in that narrowing?* The disorder you flee contains information you need. The uncertainty you avoid is charged with possibility. Not all entropy is to be minimized. Some is to be held, witnessed, appreciated.

This card appears when you need to befriend disorder, when your pursuit of certainty has cost you something vital. It does not say to maximize chaos. It says to notice what entropy offers: surprise, potential, the richness of not yet knowing. The hundred paths are bright because they are undecided.

*Affirmation: I honor the information in uncertainty. Disorder is not empty — it is full of possibility. I hold space for what is not yet decided, and I receive the light of the unknown.*
