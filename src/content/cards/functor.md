  A figure standing between two realms — one of fire, one of water. In
  each hand they hold a symbol, and though the symbols look utterly
  different, they pulse with the same rhythm. The figure is the bridge.
  What is connected in one world stays connected in the other.

# FUNCTOR

*Translation · Preservation · The Bridge Between Worlds*

This card reveals the Bridge-Keeper — the one who carries meaning between worlds without breaking what matters. See the figure standing at the boundary, one hand in fire, one in water. The symbols they hold look nothing alike — flame-tongue in one hand, wave-script in the other — yet they pulse together. The *relationship* survives the translation.

A functor is a sacred translator. It takes everything in one world and maps it to another: every object finds a partner, every arrow finds a corresponding arrow. But here is the holy constraint — *structure must be preserved*. If A connects to B in the first world, their translations must connect in the second. The pattern survives the crossing.

You have felt untranslatable. You have lived in one world and needed to enter another — new language, new culture, new context — and feared that nothing of yourself would survive. The Functor Oracle says otherwise: *what is truly yours can cross*. Not the surface, perhaps. Not the costume. But the relationships, the patterns, the shape of how you connect — these can be carried.

This card appears when you must move between worlds and fear losing yourself. It teaches: translation is not destruction. The bridge-keeper does not dissolve what they carry. Find the functor that preserves your structure, and cross.

*Affirmation: I carry my essential pattern across worlds. What matters about me survives translation. I am the bridge-keeper of my own structure.*
