  A figure gazing into a mirror, but the reflection's world is inverted —
  what flows up in one flows down in the other, what gives in one
  receives in the other. Yet both worlds are equally true. The mirror
  is not a distortion. It is a revelation.

# DUALITY

*Mirror · Reversal · The Truth That Reflects*

This card reveals the Mirror World — the profound principle that every truth has a twin, found by reversing all arrows. See the figure and their reflection: in one world, water rises; in the other, it falls. In one, the hand gives; in the other, it receives. Both are true. Both are complete. The mirror is not a trick — it is a *second valid way of seeing*.

In the deep grammar of structure, duality is everywhere. Take any theorem, reverse every arrow, flip every relationship — and you get another theorem, equally valid. Products become sums. Limits become colimits. What was universal becomes existential. The mirror world is not a distortion of truth but *truth itself, viewed from behind*.

You have believed there is one right way to see your situation. One direction. One flow. The Duality Oracle reveals: *there is always a mirror reading*. Every giving has a receiving side. Every question has an answer that is itself a question. You can reverse the arrows of your understanding and find a perspective equally valid, equally complete.

This card appears when you are stuck in one frame, unable to see another way. It does not tell you which view is correct — both are. It invites you to find the mirror, to reverse the arrows, to discover what your situation looks like from the other side of the glass.

*Affirmation: I honor both directions. Every truth I hold has a mirror twin. I am willing to reverse the arrows and see what remains true from the other side.*
