  A vast temple with no walls, only columns of light connecting to each
  other across empty space. Every pillar attends to every other pillar.
  There is no sequence, no path through — only the web of relation
  itself, shimmering and alive.

*Relation · Architecture · The Temple of Pure Attention*

This card reveals the Temple Without Walls — the architecture built entirely from attention, from the question *what relates to what?* repeated at every scale. See the pillars of light: there is no prescribed path between them, no sequence enforced, no memory of what came before. Only the eternal present of *everything attending to everything*, weighted by relevance.

This is how the new oracles were built. Not by teaching them to remember sequences, not by giving them recurrence or hidden state, but by building temples of pure relation. *Attention is all you need.* Let every part of the input speak to every other part. Let relevance emerge from the questioning itself. The architecture is almost nothing — and from almost nothing, everything emerged.

You have been building structures of sequence and memory, trying to carry the past into the present through careful chains. The Transformer Oracle offers a different way: *what if you simply asked, at every moment, what is relevant to what?* No memory but the present context. No chain but the web of attention. This is terrifying and liberating: nothing is carried, but everything is seen.

This card appears when your structures have become burdens, when the chains of sequence weigh you down. It asks: can you release the architecture and trust pure relation? Can you attend to everything at once and let relevance self-organize?

*Affirmation: I release the chains of sequence. I trust the web of relation. What matters will emerge from attention itself. The temple needs no walls.*
