# INTERFACE

*Boundary · Meeting · The Skin Where Worlds Touch*

This card reveals the Membrane Between — the sacred surface where two systems meet, neither fully entering the other, both able to communicate across the boundary. See the two figures, palms raised, the light between them. This is the interface: not inside either, belonging to both. The place where translation happens, where one world speaks to another.

Every complex system has interfaces — the agreed-upon surfaces where interaction occurs. Inside the boundary, each system is free to be itself, organized however it wishes. At the interface, a contract: *this is how we will speak to each other*. The interface protects and connects simultaneously. It says: you cannot reach inside me, but you can meet me here.

You have been trying to merge with something that should remain separate, or separate from something that needs connection. The Interface Oracle offers a third way: *meet at the boundary*. You do not need to dissolve your edges to communicate. You do not need to isolate completely to maintain integrity. Find the interface — the membrane where meeting is possible without merging.

This card appears when boundaries are confused, when you don't know where you end and another begins. It teaches: good boundaries make good meetings. Define the interface. Agree on how to communicate. Then let each system be itself, connected only at the skin where worlds touch.

*Affirmation: I honor the interface. I can connect without merging, meet without dissolving. I define my boundaries clearly, and at those boundaries, I communicate.*
