  A single path through a forest that suddenly divides into two, each
  curving away into different kinds of light — one golden, one silver.
  A figure stands at the division point, casting two shadows, one down
  each path. For this moment, they are still one. Soon they will be two.

# FORK

*Division · Multiplicity · The Path That Becomes Paths*

This card reveals the Division Point — the sacred moment when one becomes many, when the path splits and what was unified begins parallel journeys. See the figure at the fork, casting shadows down both trails. They have not yet stepped. They are still singular. But the decision approaches: golden light or silver, this future or that.

In the world of processes, a fork creates parallel realities. The original continues, and a copy continues too, both equally valid, both carrying the history up to the fork, both proceeding into different futures. This is not loss. This is multiplication. Where there was one, now there are two — and both are real.

You are facing a divergence. Part of you wants one path; part wants the other. You have been trying to find the *right* choice, as if one path were true and the other false. The Fork Oracle offers a different frame: *perhaps both paths are you*. Perhaps the division creates two valid futures, and you must simply choose which one *this* version of you will walk. The other path is not wrong — it is simply the one your shadow takes.

This card appears when you face genuine divergence, when paths separate and cannot be walked simultaneously. It does not tell you which to choose. It blesses the fork itself. Multiplicity is not tragedy. Sometimes one must become two.

*Affirmation: I honor the fork. Both paths are real. I choose one, knowing the other exists in possibility. Division is not loss — it is multiplication.*
