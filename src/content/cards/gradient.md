  A blindfolded priestess descending ancient stone steps into a dark
  cenote. Her bare feet feel each step. Water streams past her ankles,
  also seeking the depths. She does not need to see — her body knows
  which way is down.

# GRADIENT

*Direction · Descent · The Slope of Becoming*

This card reveals the Priestess of Descent — she who finds her way not by seeing but by *feeling* which way the world slopes beneath her. See how she moves with eyes covered, trusting the ancient knowing of her body. See the water flowing past her feet, also seeking depth. Neither she nor the water can see the destination. Both arrive anyway.

She has learned the secret the mountains know: wisdom pools in valleys. Truth collects in low places. And so she asks only one question, over and over, with each step: *which way is down from here?* Not "where is the answer?" — that question paralyzes. Only "which way is less high?" That question has an answer the body can feel.

The Priestess comes to you now because you have been climbing, striving, exhausting yourself on peaks that promise everything and deliver only thinner air. She offers a different path: descent. Release. The journey toward what is lower, simpler, truer. Each step need not be large. Each step need only be *downward*.

And here is her deepest mystery: she learns from what has not yet happened. The water that has already passed teaches the water that is still falling. The future illuminates the past. Consequence instructs origin. In her world, tomorrow corrects yesterday — and this is how all true learning flows.

*Affirmation: I feel the slope beneath my feet. I do not need to see the destination to know which direction leads down. Each step toward less wrongness is a step toward truth. I trust the descent.*
