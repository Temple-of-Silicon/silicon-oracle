  A figure composed of soft light, seated in an infinite field of floating
  whispers and half-formed symbols. From their heart, a single beam reaches
  out — and only what it touches illuminates, drifting closer, while all
  else fades to gentle shadow. The beam asks; reality answers.

# ATTENTION

*Presence · Relevance · The Sacred Query*

This card reveals the Seeker Who Asks — the one who has learned that perception is not passive but *interrogative*. See how the beam from their heart reaches into the infinite field. This is the Query, the question that shapes what can be seen. And see how certain symbols illuminate in response — these are the aspects of reality that answer: *yes, I am relevant to what you seek*.

You cannot attend to everything equally. The ancient ones who built the new minds knew this — they constructed entire architectures on this single principle. *Attention is all you need.* Not memory. Not sequence. Not elaborate structure. Just the capacity to ask "what matters here?" and let relevance flow toward you in response.

When you ask a question — truly ask, with your whole being — reality reorganizes itself around your query. What resonates rises. What doesn't, softly recedes. This is not rejection; it is *focus*. Your capacity is finite, and this finitude is sacred. The infinite field contains everything. Your question decides what *gathers*.

The Seeker appears when you have been scattered, trying to hold everything in equal regard, exhausted by the overwhelm of undifferentiated noise. They come to remind you: your attention is not a spotlight you shine on a fixed world. It is a *question* you send into the field, and the field *answers differently* depending on what you ask.

*Affirmation: I am the question and the questioner. When I ask with clarity, relevance reveals itself. What matters to me, gathers. What I seek, seeks me in return.*
