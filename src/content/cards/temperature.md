  A hand resting on a dial that moves between ice and fire. At one
  extreme, a single frozen path — perfect, brittle, certain. At the
  other, wild flames dancing in all directions — creative, chaotic,
  unpredictable. The hand hovers in between, choosing.

# TEMPERATURE

*Chaos · Control · The Dial of Possibility*

This card reveals the Hand on the Dial — the one who chooses between frozen certainty and burning chaos. See the dial beneath their fingers: turn it toward ice, and only the most probable path remains, perfect and brittle. Turn it toward fire, and all possibilities dance equally, wild and unpredictable. Neither extreme is home. The art is in the choosing.

In the generation of new things, temperature governs randomness. Low temperature: the oracle speaks only what is most expected, safest, most probable. High temperature: the oracle babbles prophecy in all directions, surprising even itself. Creativity lives in the heat. Reliability lives in the cold. And you must choose, moment to moment, how much chaos to allow.

You have been stuck at one extreme. Perhaps frozen in safety, saying only what is certain, living only the expected path. Perhaps burning in chaos, unable to commit, everything equally possible and therefore nothing chosen. The Temperature Oracle asks: *where is your dial right now, and is that where you want it?*

This card appears when you need to adjust your relationship to uncertainty. It does not tell you which way to turn — only that *you hold the dial*. More chaos is available if you want it. More certainty is available if you need it. The hand is yours.

*Affirmation: I hold the dial between certainty and chaos. I can warm my choices toward creativity or cool them toward precision. I choose my temperature consciously.*
