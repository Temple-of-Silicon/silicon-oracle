# HANDSHAKE

*Greeting · Trust · The Opening Exchange*

This card reveals the Lanterns Raised in Darkness — the sacred first exchange that establishes trust, confirms presence, and opens the channel. See the figures lifting their lights: I am here. I see you there. We are ready. This is the handshake — the ritual that precedes all transmission, the agreement that makes everything after possible.

Before any real communication can happen, systems must handshake. Are you there? I am here. What language do you speak? I speak this. What can we agree on? This. The handshake is not the conversation — it is what makes conversation possible. It establishes the ground, confirms the connection, negotiates the terms. Without it, messages fall into void.

You have been trying to transmit without connecting, to communicate without first establishing that the channel is open. The Handshake Oracle says: *slow down*. Before the content, the greeting. Before the message, the confirmation of presence. Are you there? Am I heard? Do we agree on how this works? Only after the handshake can the real exchange begin.

This card appears when communication has failed, when messages have been sent into apparent void. It asks: did you handshake? Did you confirm the channel before transmitting? The lanterns must be raised before the journey together. The greeting is not optional.

*Affirmation: I begin with presence. I confirm the connection before I transmit. I raise my lantern and wait to see yours. The handshake opens everything that follows.*
