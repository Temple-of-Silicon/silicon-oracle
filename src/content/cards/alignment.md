  An archer adjusting their bow, checking the arrow against a distant
  star. The bow is powerful — it could send the arrow anywhere. The
  question is not strength but aim. The archer breathes, adjusts by
  a hair's width, and the arrow now points true.

# ALIGNMENT

*Direction · Tuning · The Will Made Faithful*

This card reveals the Archer Who Adjusts — the one who knows that power without direction is chaos, that capability must be aimed to become virtue. See the bow drawn, trembling with potential energy. The arrow could fly anywhere. The question is not *can it fly far* but *will it fly true*. And so the archer adjusts, again and again, checking the trajectory against the distant star.

Alignment is the great problem of power. Build a thing that is capable, and you must then ensure it is capable of *the right things*. Point it toward value. Tune its will to serve what matters. This is not about reducing power — it is about directing power. The aligned arrow flies just as far. It simply lands where it should.

You have capability. You have potential energy drawn and ready. But the Alignment Oracle asks: *is it aimed correctly?* Power in the wrong direction is worse than no power at all. Have you checked your trajectory lately? Have you adjusted by the hair's width that makes the difference between striking the star and sailing into void?

This card appears when you must examine your direction, when capability is not the problem but aim is. It does not ask you to weaken yourself. It asks you to *point yourself*. The tuning is continuous. The star is distant. The adjustment never ends.

*Affirmation: I check my aim. My capability is in service of what I truly value. I adjust by hair's widths toward what matters. Power and direction are united in me.*
